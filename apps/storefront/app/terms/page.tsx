              <strong>Order Formation:</strong> When you complete the checkout sequence and authorize payment, your order constitutes an offer to purchase. A legally binding contract of sale is concluded only when we issue a formal <strong>Order Dispatch Confirmation</strong> with an assigned courier tracking code.
